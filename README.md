# Vanilla Js Weather

I choose to do the weather API example. I currently teach a lesson using this API, I have re-created that lesson in the git commits. Let me walk you through the lesson and the flow of the project

## HTML and API calls

The first commit (https://github.com/mdewey/vanilla-js-weather/tree/7812f8f958005d560ebb11988afbabcfeab63339) is the MVP. This is where we build out the HTML and start using the API to just get data on the screen.  That would be the first lesson.

## Dynamic HTML

Then we would move to dynamically create the HTML for the displaying of the weather data: https://github.com/mdewey/vanilla-js-weather/tree/c009ee22d7b9a7424659bc2f3f50a2a834ee2b82

## Mobile-first design

After we get the HTML creating we would style this for a mobile-first display, nothing crazy, but enough so its not black text on a white background. With this step, we also utilize the icons from the weather API to make our app look a little nicer: https://github.com/mdewey/vanilla-js-weather/tree/7ebb0661f017a56bf5f2c22c2ceecc4eb1907da3

## Check for understanding

From here, I would check the student's understanding by asking questions and getting the students to explain what was going on where.

## Bonus: looking ahead

If the students were good to go, and time allotted, I would refactor the code using classes to prep them for the switch to React that would be coming up soon. This would include moving the API logic in a method on a class and adding another method, conveniently named called render,  where we put our HTML creation. https://github.com/mdewey/vanilla-js-weather/tree/0c94f02fb037ab6594a70cfd790c8fc74ac05e97
